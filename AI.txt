🔹 Roman Urdu

Artificial Intelligence wo technology hai jisme computer ya machine ko aisi ability di jati hai ke wo soch sake, seekh sake aur decision le sake, bilkul insaan ki tarah.
AI systems data se learn karte hain aur phir us data ki madad se problems solve, predictions aur automation karte hain.

Examples:

Google Assistant / Siri
Face Recognition
Self-driving cars
ChatGPT 🤖

🔹 English

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.
These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding language.

Examples:
Virtual assistants
Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)
Image and speech recognition
Autonomous vehicles


✅ English (Correct & Clear)

When human capabilities such as thinking, learning, and decision-making are embedded into machines, it is called Artificial Intelligence (AI).


Artificial General Intelligence
🔹 Roman Urdu

Aik AI tab Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) kehlati hai,
jab wo sirf aik kaam nahi, balkay insaan ki tarah har qisam ka kaam samajh aur seekh sakay —
jaise natural intelligence (insaani aqal) hoti hai.

Abhi jo AI hum use kar rahe hain wo Natural Intelligence nahi hoti,
kyon ke natural intelligence sirf insaan ke paas hoti hai.
AI artificial hoti hai, chahe wo kitni hi advanced kyun na ho.

👉 AGI = Artificial + General + Insaan jaisi samajh


Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a type of AI that can understand, learn, and perform any task a human can.
It is artificial, not natural intelligence, because it is created by machines, not humans.




Narrow AI (ANI)

Roman: Narrow AI sirf ek specific kaam ke liye banai jati hai aur us se aagay soch nahi sakti.
English: Narrow AI is designed to perform only one specific task.

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

Roman: AGI wo AI hoti hai jo insaan ki tarah har qisam ka kaam samajh aur seekh sakti hai.
English: AGI is an AI that can understand, learn, and perform any task a human can.

Super Intelligence (ASI)

Roman: ASI wo AI hoti hai jo har maamlay mein insaan se zyada smart hoti hai.
English: Super Intelligence is an AI that exceeds human intelligence in all areas.


Humanoid Robot kya hai?

Roman Urdu:
Humanoid robot wo robot hota hai jo insaan ki shakal aur movements jaisa hota hai, jaise chalna, haath hilana aur baat karna.

English:
A humanoid robot is a robot designed to look and act like a human, including human-like body structure and movements.



Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Roman: AI aik broad concept hai jisme machines ko insaan jaisa smart banaya jata hai.
English: AI is a broad field that enables machines to simulate human intelligence.

Machine Learning (ML)

Roman: ML, AI ka hissa hai jisme machine data se khud seekhti hai, bina explicitly program kiye.
English: ML is a subset of AI where machines learn from data.

Deep Learning (DL)

Roman: DL, ML ka advanced form hai jo neural networks ka use karta hai.
English: DL is a subset of ML that uses deep neural networks.

Generative AI (GAI)

Roman: GAI wo AI hoti hai jo naya content generate karti hai, jaise text, image, ya code.
English: Generative AI creates new content like text, images, or code.







Alan Turing

Roman:
Alan Turing aik British mathematician aur computer scientist thay, jinhen AI ka father kaha jata hai.

English:
Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist, known as the father of Artificial Intelligence.

Turing Test

Roman:
Turing Test aik test hai jisme dekha jata hai ke machine insaan jaisa response de sakti hai ya nahi.

English:
The Turing Test checks whether a machine can behave like a human in conversation.

Birth of Artificial Intelligence

Roman:
Artificial Intelligence ka start 1956 mein hua jab is field ka naam officially Artificial Intelligence rakha gaya.

English:
Artificial Intelligence was born in 1956, when the term “Artificial Intelligence” was officially introduced.

First Chatbot (ELIZA)

Roman:
ELIZA duniya ka pehla chatbot tha, jise Joseph Weizenbaum ne banaya.

English:
ELIZA was the world’s first chatbot, created by Joseph Weizenbaum.














Artificial Intelligence (AI)

When human capabilities such as thinking, learning, and decision-making are embedded into machines, it is called Artificial Intelligence (AI).

1️⃣ Narrow AI (ANI – Artificial Narrow Intelligence)
Definition: Designed to perform only one specific task.
Capabilities: Cannot do tasks outside its programming.

Examples:
Google Search
Siri, Alex
Facial recognition software used in security systems.

2️⃣ Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
Definition: AI that can understand, learn, and perform any task a human can.
Capabilities: Flexible, human-like intelligence across multiple domains.
Status: Theoretical; does not exist yet.

3️⃣ Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
Definition: AI that exceeds human intelligence in all areas.
Capabilities: Outperforms humans in creativity, decision-making, reasoning.
Status: Purely hypothetical / futuristic.


A humanoid robot is a robot designed to look and act like a human, including:

Human-like body structure (head, torso, arms, legs)
Human-like movements and gestures
Sometimes even facial expressions and speech
